## Available Scripts

Make sure your design and website idea are unique. First, finalize your idea (What type of website do you want to build). Then google the site design or visit ThemeForest to get your website idea. However, your website can not relate to your previous assignments or any demo project displayed in the course or our conceptual sessions.

Give your website a name. The name should appear on the website and be displayed on the website's title.

It will contain a navbar with the options: website logo, website name, Courses, FAQ, Blog, toggle theme (dark/ light), and User Profile Picture (or login). The user profile picture on the navbar is conditional. If the user is signed in, the navbar will show the profile pic. The user's name will be visible when the mouse is in the picture.

After clicking "Log in," it will redirect to a login page. 3 types of login systems you have to implement: Email & password login, Google, and GitHub login. The login page will have a toggle option to go to the register page.

In your Email and Password registration form, there should be an input box for "Full name," where the user will type their full name. Other fields will be Photo URL, Email, and Password.

Clicking "Courses" in the navbar (You can change this name to any meaningful name according to your design, but the purpose of this button should be the same according to our description) will redirect to a page that shows the courses. (Creating a fake dataset is necessary here). You have to create at least 6 courses (fake data). Design & course information is all up to you. (Load data from the server side - must). You can create one, two, or more courses in a row.

The Courses page will be divided into two parts: a sidebar (either on the left side or on the right side according to your design) & content detail section. In the sidebar, there will be at least 6 options (course options or course categories, or anything else). Every option is clickable. (You will need to create necessary fake data)

When you click an option (course card or an option on the left/right sidebar), It will take you to the course detail page. Content details depend on you. But, it must include a header, introductory description/course body, and one image. All details must be relevant to the topic. You may include a bullet list/ table/ chart if needed.
